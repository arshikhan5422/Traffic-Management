🚦 Smart Traffic Management through Anomaly Detection and Load Balancing

This project presents an intelligent traffic management system designed to optimize urban traffic flow by detecting anomalies in real-time and efficiently distributing vehicle load across available routes. The system leverages YOLOv5 for real-time object detection and MobileNet for lightweight classification, enabling high accuracy with reduced latency.

📌 Features

Real-Time Vehicle Detection using YOLOv5

Anomaly Detection (accidents, congestion, unusual patterns)

Load Balancing by rerouting vehicles to alternate roads

Lightweight Model Integration with MobileNet for efficiency

Scalability for Smart Cities – adaptable to IoT and VANETs

Improved Emergency Response with faster detection of critical events

🏗️ System Architecture

Input – Real-time video feed or traffic camera footage

Detection – YOLOv5 detects vehicles and anomalies

Classification – MobileNet classifies detected anomalies

Load Balancing – Intelligent routing distributes traffic flow

Output – Real-time traffic insights, alerts, and optimized routes
